# BusMonitor
Code that will let a microcontroller get the contents of the busses of my 8-bit computer and then send them to me through a serial interface.

This is both my first C project and first microcontroller project (not including arduino) so any feedback is welcome.

This code was written for the ATMega162(V), since that was what I had around. Since all I really need are 12 IO pins and a serial port,I probably could have used something smaller. A 328P might a good choice because of how cheap they have become.
