# 8-Bit Utils
## Summary
The point of thse programs are to assist me in building and using the 8-Bit computer that I am building. The whole project is a way for me to learn more about computer architecture and how computers work.
Part of this excercise is that I would have to program it manually, but after I am finished learning how to program it, it would be nice to have a way to program it from another computer, just by typing in values for the memory and clicking a button. Another usefull thing to have would be something to gather all of the data and control signals being sent through the computer. Having LEDs attached to all the pins may serve as a useful visual aide, if you have the computer running at a relatively quick speed, it is easy to miss the LEDs as they flash faster than you can keep up. Another problem with this is that they draw a large amount of power, especailly if I were to use almost a hundred of them, so being able to check the status on a terminal would mean that the computer draws less power and puts less strain on the chips.

## Debugger
The goal of this is to be able to check on both the control signals and the data bus going through the computer. Simply having LEDs attached to all of the pins is defenitely a much easier solution than writing a program to check on all of the bits for you, but you need many of them, and they draw a lot of power and put strain on the chips.
